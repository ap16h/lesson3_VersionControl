            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A version control system is a system that records changes to a file or group of files over times so that you can remember certain versions later on. Using version control systems is very wise because files are easy to recover if you purposely or accidentally delete files while working. There are different types of version control systems. For example, there are local, centralized, and distributed version control systems. Local means that all of the files are kept under revision control. Centralized means that the files are easier to use in a group setting. Using this type means that each person knows what they need to do in those files, etc. Distributed means that clients do not have a copy of the files, but a mirror image so just in case your server dies, you can copy all of the info from the client's repository. One way to save all of your past versions of coding is by naming them with different dates and file names, its not ideal, but it is better than losing files or past versions of your files. Version Control Systems can also note who changed the file, when the changes were made, what is new and different, and you can merge all of the changes to the same file.  </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A repository is defined as a place or receptable where things are made to be stored. They can hold files and folders, images, videos, and data sets. You will ideally be making snapshots of your work every time you want to make a specific save in your work, just in case you want to come back later. This is useful because if you don't like what you have edited, you can go back to a save in your repository and reset your code to what you had before. A source code repository is a file archive and web hosting facility where a large amount of source code, for software or for web pages, is kept, either publicly or privately. They are often used by open-source software projects and other multi-developer projects to handle various versions. A specific repository that we are using is GIT.   </p>

        <!-- Third Featurette -->
        <div class="featurette" id="topic3">

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Highlight #3:
                <span class="text-muted">GIT</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git stores and thinks about information is a different way compared to other version control systems. A major difference is the fact that Git saves in snapshots. This is an effective way to save past files without having to store the file again, making Git more of a mini filesystem. Git also has integrity, which means that Git always checksums the data stored. This is important because that means that you cant lose information in transit or get file corruption without Git knowing about it and being able to detect it. The three states that your file can stay in are committed, modified, and staged. Committed meaning it is safely stored in your local database, modified meaning you changed the file but haven't committedit yet, and staged meaning you marked the modified file to go to you next commit snapshot. The three main parts of a Git project are the staging are, the directory, and the working tree. The directory is where the data is stored, which is the most important part. The working tree is a single version of your project, you can place the files on a disk to use and modify. The staging area is a file that stores information that will go into your next commit, you could also call this the index.  </p>

                <span class="text-muted">GIT Basic Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Examples of GIT basic commands include: commit, push, pull, and clone. The ones that are very important for us to use this semester are add, commit, and push, in that order exactly. To commit, you are recording changes made to files to the local repository. To push you are sending local commits to remote repositories. You pull to get the latest version of a repository. To clone, you are basically creating a local working copy of an existing remote repository. A couple of commands we have had to use for this assignment were "git init", which creates the new local repository, "git commit -m """ is used to make a basic commit, and the last one was "git config --global user.name" and "git config -global user.email "our email", which were used to tell Git who I was. I would use this in my Cloud 9 "workspace" to tell it to connect and push my files into my Github repository. </p>

            <p class="lead">This IDE-based browser is what we are using as our remote repository this semester. This system has many coding languages including c++, Python, and JavaScript so it is very loosely typed. When using Cloud 9 you have access to your work environment regardless of where you are, it is open source, so you can look at others code and people could look into your code, and you can link your Github account. Cloud 9 is free and you do not have to download it o your computer. Something very convenient that Cloud 9 also does for its users is having good debugging support.  Cloud 9 is very flexible when running your development and you do not even have to download anything to make it work. You can also easily collaborate on Cloud 9 in real time, there is even a chat option to see while coding. the experience is very similar to Google Drive. It is rather easy to start new projects using this system as well. When using Cloud 9 it is also amazing because it doesnt matter if you have no experience with coding or 10 years worth of experience, anybody can use it. </p>
